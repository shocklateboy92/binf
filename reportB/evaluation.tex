\chapter{Evaluation}\label{ch:eval}

\section{Goals}
Explain the dynamic goals that were defined, and how they were designed to be scaled back as complications arose, and time permitted. 

Also should I explain that those goals were originally set with a group project in mind, and that's the primary reason they had to be scaled back so far?

\section{Current State}
Will describe the features that the new version supports already, will support in the future.

Should I emphasise that this is a work in progress?

\section{Performance}
This section will outline the performance improvements, probably show some benchmark comparisons between it and the old one.

\section{Maintenance}
Will describe how the new version will be easier to maintain.
