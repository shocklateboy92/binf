\chapter{Evaluation}\label{ch:eval}

\section{Goals}
Explain the dynamic goals that were defined, and how they were designed to be scaled back as complications arose, and time permitted. 

Also should I explain that those goals were originally set with a group project in mind, and that's the primary reason they had to be scaled back so far?

\section{Current State}
Will describe the features that the new version supports already, will support in the future.

Should I emphasise that this is a work in progress?

\section{Performance}

\subsection{Runtime}
While there are many different aspects when it comes to the performance of computer programs, in this case we care about run-time specifically. 

This is actually quite straightforward to compare; both implementations were given the same workload, and had their total execution times measured. The inputs sequences were carefully chosen to ensure they only required features that are currently supported by both of them.

\subsection{Parallelism}
As described in detail in \secref{sec:concurrency}, parallelism is essential for modern high performance applications. While computers are increasing in total computational power these days faster than ever before, performance for single threaded applications have effectively stagnated, by virtue of clock speeds stagnating. 

It is clear from the analysis performed in \secref{arg1}

The new implementation of iHMMuneAlign was designed from scratch with performance in mind, dictating choice of language, frameworks/libraries, as well as various architectural decisions. 

\section{Maintenance}
Will describe how the new version will be easier to maintain.
