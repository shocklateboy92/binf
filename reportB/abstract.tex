iHMMuneAlign is an alignment program created by researchers at UNSW that uses a hidden Markov model (HMM) to model the processes involved in human IGH gene rearrangement and maturation.

However, the original implementation has been unable to keep up with increasing workloads in recent years. This document outlines a research project conducted to investigate the most effective way of increasing its performance.

It presents the reasoning behind the decision to reimplement iHMMuneAlign from scratch; describes the process in detail, and finally demonstrates its effectiveness by comparing it with the old implementation.
